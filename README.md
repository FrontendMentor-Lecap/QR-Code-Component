## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I used this challenge to practice absolute value and the box model. It was more of remembering than learning new things.

### Continued development

Continued development must be done with screen resolution variations and the use of media queries. Using also relative units must be practiced and learned with other challenges.
